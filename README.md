# Ehem Foundation

This project was developed in collaboration with the SVAD Department at Beaconhouse National University.

## Overview

Judicial practices in different parts of the world have varying levels of success when it comes to the rights of women. Particularly in Pakistan, the judicial system has often failed to provide women with the support they rightfully deserve. This project aims to address these failures in multiple contexts, including:

- **Inheritance Laws**
- **Workplace Rights**
- **Marriage Contracts (Nikkah Nama)**
- **Domestic Abuse**

The current laws rarely have a meaningful effect in serving justice due to several challenges, including:

- Lack of ethical practices in the judiciary
- Lack of ease of process and counsel
- Delays resulting from court scheduling
- Lack of prioritization

These pervasive issues require a new and contextually appropriate solution. Our solution involves creating an application and a website designed to:

- Follow a swifter process focusing on equality and human-centered design
- Emphasize the rights of women
- Create a supportive community for women in Pakistan

## Objectives

- Provide a streamlined process for women to seek justice and support
- Offer resources and information on women's rights and legal practices
- Foster a community where women can share experiences and support each other

## Methodology

The study and development of this project are built upon the knowledge of subject matter experts and secondary sources, including:

- Books
- Journals
- Interviews
- Internet platforms
